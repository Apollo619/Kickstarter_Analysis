Data_Analytics_Kickstarter_Project

Louise, based on a thourgh analysis of kickstarters with similar criteria you have tasked me to analyze, I recommend starting a Kickstarter campaign for your theatrical play in May or June as they show the most signs of success. Based on previous successful campaigns a goal of 2,000 pounds is the ideal target for a successful pledge. See below charts and graphs for visual aids.
